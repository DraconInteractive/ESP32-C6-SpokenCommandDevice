# Spoken Command Server

Local HTTP bridge between the ESP32-C6 board and ElevenLabs Speech to Text.

## Run

```sh
cp .env.example .env.local
$EDITOR .env.local
source .env.local
python3 server.py
```

The server listens on `0.0.0.0:8080` by default.

## Endpoints

- `GET /health` returns a basic health check.
- `GET /devices` returns known devices and their server-side state.
- `GET /devices/{device_id}` returns one known device.
- `GET /devices/{device_id}/events` returns and clears the next queued device
  event.
- `POST /devices/events` queues an event for all currently known devices.
  Example:

```sh
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/devices/events \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"type":"alert","display_text":"Alert","tone":"alert"}'
```

- `POST /devices/{device_id}/events` queues an event for a device. Example:

```sh
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/devices/waveshare-c6-fde0e0/events \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"type":"alert","display_text":"Alert","tone":"alert"}'
```

- `POST /devices/{device_id}/register` records device metadata for devices
  that do not post audio or poll events. Example camera registration:

```sh
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/devices/timercam-x-a1b2c3/register \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"type":"camera","model":"M5Stack TimerCamera-X","capabilities":["capture","stream"],"endpoints":{"root":"http://192.168.4.50/","capture":"http://192.168.4.50/capture","stream":"http://192.168.4.50/stream"},"status":{"ip":"192.168.4.50"}}'
```

- `GET /commands/recent` returns recent transcripts kept in memory. Add
  `?device_id=waveshare-c6-fdda98` to filter by device.
- `POST /audio/command` accepts either WAV or raw PCM audio. Raw PCM may use a
  normal `Content-Length` request or HTTP chunked transfer. It returns a compact
  device response:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "transcript": "test",
  "command": "test",
  "display_text": "Ready.",
  "tone": "success",
  "state": {
    "muted": false
  }
}
```

For raw PCM, send:

```text
Content-Type: application/octet-stream
X-Audio-Sample-Rate: 16000
X-Audio-Channels: 1
X-Device-Id: waveshare-c6-fdda98
```

Firmware derives `X-Device-Id` from the board Wi-Fi MAC suffix, so each physical
board has separate mute state, pending prompts, and command history.

The current ElevenLabs STT call uses `POST https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/speech-to-text`,
`model_id=scribe_v2`, and a multipart `file` field.

## Built-in Commands

- `test` or `ping` returns `Ready.`
- `status` returns `Server online.`
- `help` returns a short command list.
- `cancel` cancels a pending command prompt.
- `mute` disables response tones for that device.
- `unmute` enables response tones for that device.
- `repeat ...` or `say ...` displays the spoken suffix.
- `timer`, `set timer`, or `set a timer` asks for a duration if one was not
  supplied. The next response from the same device completes the timer.
- `alert`, `show alert`, or `show an alert on all devices` queues an alert event
  for the current device or all known devices.
- Anything else displays `Heard: ...`.

Example timer exchange:

```text
User: set a timer
Device: How long should the timer be?
User: 5 minutes
Device: Timer set: 5 min
```
